## Welcome to Begg 👋

At the heart of Begg is a payment format that revolutionizes the future of payments with advancing technological devices and less influence from economy controllers. Begg is just a mobile app that utilizes this technology to make requesting funds socially inclusive and easily transfer money from one person to another.

Begg has features that require the fastest payment protocols like physical begging and will use this groundbreaking technology as a test in the market. 

Begg is a proposed mobile application designed to facilitate peer-to-peer financial assistance among users, including loans specifically for students. By leveraging social connectivity and fostering a sense of mutual support, Begg aims to provide a platform where individuals can discreetly solicit and provide monetary assistance. We also would be extending to a global request feature and giveaway social network where people can give a beg-cap(Amount they need) and have people fund it. Do Beggquest(A giveaway action where people post money bugs and people can easily receive the money assigned for each person). This will increase usage of the app and allow user retention. Crowdfunding is the bigger picture I guess.
